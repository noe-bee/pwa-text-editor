# pwa-text-editor

## Description

- The purpose of this week's challenge was to create an offline text editor app that can be used whenever and wherever! In order to be able to create this particular app, service workers and databases were needed so that user input would be stored in the backend even while offline. What makes this app special from other apps I have created is that this app is so simple and convenient to use. Creating this app gave me a glimpse of how everyday apps work even while offline.

## Installation

- This application should look like the following image when installed properly:

 All that is needed for installation is to click the "install" button, go to your downloads on your current browser, and then find and click on "jate" on downloads to download the app!


## Usage
- To use this application, simply type whatever you want such as notes, recipes, or cheatsheet codes.
